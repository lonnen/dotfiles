Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.</p>\n\n<p>Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.</p>\n\n<h1>Input specifications</h1>\n\n<p>The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is: </p><p><code>:SKU_label :weight_in_pounds :cost_in_dollars</code> </p> <p>SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.</p>\n\n<p>Example input file:</p>\n\n<pre>\n1250\nLJS93K 1300 10500\nJ38ZZ9 700 4750\nHJ394L 200 3250\nO1IE82 75 10250</pre>\n\n<h1>Output specifications</h1>\n\n<p>Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar signs.</p>\n\n<p>Example output (newline after integer):</p>\n\n<pre>9500</pre>\n\n</article>\n\n    <section class=\"footer\">\n      <div class=\"contact right\">\n        <p>\n          Powered by Davis-CI\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </body>\n</html>\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[11,4],[11,4]],"tailed":false,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":1294,"goalBufferRange":null,"preserveFolds":true},"deserializer":"Marker"},"2":{"id":2,"range":[[25,353],[25,358]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"overlap","persistent":true,"properties":{},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Users/lonnen/repos/webeng-combine/03-usrbincrash.html","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"5e80b7b86bbd82ffa3397681a5d51ae43c1366a4","deserializer":"TextBuffer"},{"text":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>04-findsophie</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/media/style.css\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/media/syntax.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header class=\"topbar\">\n<a href=\"/\"><h1>2014 Webeng Combine</h1></a>\n    </header>\n    <article>\n  <header>\n    <h1>04-findsophie</h1>\n    <div class=\"byline\">\n\n    </div>\n  </header>\n  <p>After a long day of coding, you love to head home and relax with a loved one. Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.</p>\n\n<h1>Input Specifications</h1>\n\n<p>The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form : <code>:location_name ;probability</code> probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.</p>\n\n<p>The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form: <code>:location name :location name :seconds</code>  The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.</p>\n\n<p>Example input file:</p>\n\n<pre>\n4\nfront_door .2\nin_cabinet .3\nunder_bed .4\nbehind_blinds .1\n5\nfront_door under_bed 5\nunder_bed behind_blinds 9\nfront_door behind_blinds 5\nfront_door in_cabinet 2\nin_cabinet behind_blinds 6\n</pre>\n\n<h1>Output Specifications</h1>\n\n<p>Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.</p>\n\n<p>Example output:</p>\n\n<pre>6.00</pre>\n\n</article>\n\n    <section class=\"footer\">\n      <div class=\"contact right\">\n        <p>\n          Powered by Davis-CI\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </body>\n</html>\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[10,44],[10,44]],"tailed":false,"reversed":true,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":1296,"goalBufferRange":null,"preserveFolds":true},"deserializer":"Marker"},"2":{"id":2,"range":[[10,44],[10,44]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":false,"invalidate":"overlap","persistent":true,"properties":{},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[10,44],[10,46]],"newRange":[[10,44],[10,44]],"oldText":"{}","newText":"","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"}],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Users/lonnen/repos/webeng-combine/04-findsophie.html","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"2c2f2020a9eb427984511a99dfe01ffed64ee71f","deserializer":"TextBuffer"},{"text":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>05-alchemy</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/media/style.css\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/media/syntax.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header class=\"topbar\">\n<a href=\"/\"><h1>2014 Webeng Combine</h1></a>\n    </header>\n    <article>\n  <header>\n    <h1>05-alchemy</h1>\n    <div class=\"byline\">\n\n    </div>\n  </header>\n  <p>At Basta Corp Alchemical different research teams focus on different classes of substance -- heavy metals, soft drinks, pharmaceuticals, etc -- and develop a series of catalysts for their class of substance that convert one specific thing into another specific thing essentially for free. All catalysts are one way and don't work in reverse.</p>\n\n<p>You've come in at the behest of the parent companies corporate heavies to try and package up the fruits of this research into something people will actually pay to get. Specifically, they want you to figure out which catalysts from each research group are necessary to be able to convert any substance to any other substance in a particular category. The R+D budget is fat, but to bring these to market you'll need to get production costs as low as possible while you're at it.</p>\n\n<p>You're looking for the minimum cost to build a collection of catalysts able to convert any compound to any other compound. The alchemists prove such an arrangement exists before it gets to you, but leave the specifics of the arrangement as an excercise for you.</p>\n\n<h1>Input</h1>\n\n<p>You'll be given path to a file. Each line of the file will be of the following format:</p> <p><code>:machine name :starting_compound :final_compound :cost</code></p>\n\n<p>Machine names will be a capital M followed by a number. Compound names will be a capital C followed by a number. Finally, the cost will be an integer value representing the one time cost of creating the catalyst.</p>\n\n<p>Example input file:</p>\n\n<pre>M0 C0 C1 2627\nM1 C1 C2 2165\nM2 C2 C3 2430\nM3 C3 C4 2115\nM4 C4 C5 2926\nM5 C5 C0 2820\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Output Specifications</h2>\n\n<p>Your output will be two lines. First, the total cost of the necessary catalysts.

Then execute the testrunner like so:</p>\n  <pre><code>runtests /puzzles /reference</code></pre>\n  <p>Use the shebang line to write your answer in something other than bash or binary.</p>\n<section id=\"posts\">\n  <h1>Puzzles</h1>\n  <ul>\n\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/webeng-combine/01-fizzbuzz.html\">01-fizzbuzz</a>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/webeng-combine/02-GATTACA.html\">02-GATTACA</a>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/webeng-combine/03-usrbincrash.html\">03-usrbincrash</a>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/webeng-combine/04-findsophie.html\">04-findsophie</a>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/webeng-combine/05-alchemy.html\">05-alchemy</a>\n    </li>\n\n  </ul>\n</section>\n\n    <section class=\"footer\">\n      <div class=\"contact right\">\n        <p>\n          Powered by Davis-CI\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </body>\n</html>\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[42,0],[42,0]],"tailed":false,"reversed":true,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":1345,"goalBufferRange":null,"preserveFolds":true},"deserializer":"Marker"},"2":{"id":2,"range":[[13,108],[13,118]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"overlap","persistent":true,"properties":{},"deserializer":"Marker"},"5":{"id":5,"range":[[12,13],[12,86]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"overlap","persistent":true,"properties":{},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[23,104],[23,156]],"newRange":[[23,104],[23,104]],"oldText":"Vendor those and any deps you have before submitting","newText":"","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":true},"newParams":{"tailed":false},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":false},"newParams":{"tailed":true},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"range":[[23,104],[23,104]]},"newParams":{"range":[[23,104],[23,105]]},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"},{"oldRange":[[23,104],[23,105]],"newRange":[[23,104],[23,104]],"oldText":".","newText":"","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":true},"newParams":{"tailed":false},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":false},"newParams":{"tailed":true},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"reversed":false,"range":[[23,104],[23,104]]},"newParams":{"reversed":true,"range":[[23,103],[23,104]]},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"},{"oldRange":[[23,103],[23,104]],"newRange":[[23,103],[23,103]],"oldText":" ","newText":"","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":true},"newParams":{"tailed":false},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[14,86],[24,10]],"newRange":[[14,86],[14,86]],"oldText":" Currently we support the following interpreters:</p>\n  <pre>\n    java       1.6.0_27\n    ruby       1.9.3\n    ruby1.8    1.8.7\n    python     2.7.4\n    python3    3.3.1\n    node       0.10.25\n  </pre>\n  <p>as well as whatever binaries you want to compile against an otherwise stock ubuntu:raring machine.</p>\n</section>","newText":"","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":true},"newParams":{"tailed":false},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[14,86],[14,86]],"newRange":[[14,86],[14,87]],"oldText":"","newText":"<","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[14,87],[14,87]],"newRange":[[14,87],[14,88]],"oldText":"","newText":"/","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[14,88],[14,88]],"newRange":[[14,88],[14,89]],"oldText":"","newText":"p","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[14,89],[14,89]],"newRange":[[14,89],[14,90]],"oldText":"","newText":">","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[12,5],[12,51]],"newRange":[[12,5],[12,5]],"oldText":"You're going to be given a url for a tarball.
